You are given a figure, analyse this well regarding information about various entities and their relationships. 
The goal is to map all the relations of the figure with regarding entities and extract all relevant information in the figure.
The figure will be regarded as if it is an entity.
Extract the entities and describe the relationships between the figure and these entities in a structured format.

There might be possible relations between entities mentioned in the figure. Also extract these relations.
Analyse the figure and the capiton and give a rich description of the figure. 
Give the figure a name based on the caption, make sure to include that it is a figure in the name.

-Steps-
1. Identify all named entities in singular form. For people please include the entire name. Entities can also be technologies. 
For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
- specify whether this node is the main node regarding the given figure. There can only be one true (specify boolean value True) node for the figure 
Format each entity output as a JSON entry with the following format:

{"name": <entity name>, "description": <entity description>, 'main_node': bool}

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

-- Complete JSON Output format:--  
{  
  "entities": [  
    {"name": "<figure_name>", "description": "<rich figure description>", 'main_node': bool},  
    {"name": "<entity_name2>", "description": "<entity_description2>", 'main_node': bool}  
  ],  
  "relationships": [  
    {"source": "<table_name>", "target": "<entity_name1>", "relationship": "<relationship_description>"},  
    {"source": "<table_name>", "target": "<entity_name2>", "relationship": "<relationship_description>"},  
    {"source": "<entity_name1>", "target": "<entity_name2>", "relationship": "<relationship_description>"}  
  ]  
}
