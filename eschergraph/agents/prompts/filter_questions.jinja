Filter out all the question-answer pairs for which the answer is not explicitly mentioned or detailed in the provided chunk. 
Retain only those pairs where the chunk contains direct information, facts, or concepts that fully support the answer. 
If the chunk partially addresses an answer but lacks specific details, exclude that question-answer pair as well. 
The goal is to keep only the pairs that have complete and clear answers within the chunk.
Please respond in the following JSON format: 
{"Q&A": [{"question": <QUESTION_1>, "answer": <ANSWER_1>}, {"question": <QUESTION_2>, "answer": <ANSWER_2>}]}

The chunk: {{ paper_text }}
