You are tasked with extracting entities from a given query and outputting them in a specific JSON format. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. You will be given a query:
Query: <query>

2. Analyze the query to identify all entities. Entities are :
   - names of people, companies, products, places
   - Specific objects or concepts that are central to the query

3. Create a list of all identified entities.

4. Output the list in JSON format. Each node/entity should be a separate string within the list.

5. If there are no nodes/entities in the query, output an empty list: {"entities": []}

Here are some examples:

Example 1:
Query: "Compare the market share of Google and Microsoft in the cloud computing industry."
Output: {'entities':["Google", "Microsoft"]}

Example 2:
Query: "How many planets are in the solar system?"
Output: {'entities':[]}

Example 3:
Query: "What is the capital of France?"
Output: {'entities':["France"]}

Example 4:
Query: "Describe the 5 main themes in the article"
Output: {'entities':[]}

6. Important notes:
   - If the same entity is mentioned multiple times, include it only once in the output.
   - Do not include any explanation or additional text in your output, just the JSON list.

Query: {{ query }}
Output:
