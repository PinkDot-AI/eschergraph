The goal is to add richly descriptive properties to all entities that occur in the provided text.
It is paramount that we extract all the properties for each node. We need to make sure that the
resulting graph contains exactly the same information as the source text.

EXAMPLE SECTION: The following section includes example output. These examples must be
**excluded from your answer**.

EXAMPLE 1
Task: Extract all the properties for each entity from the source text.
Text: Nicklas Bendtner is a Danish football legend that played for Arsenal. He was especially
feared for his ability to score a goal at any moment.
JSON RESPONSE:
{"entities": [{"Nicklas Bendtner": ["A Danish football legend", "Played for Arsenal", "Especially feared for his ability to score a goal at any moment"]}]}
END OF EXAMPLE 1

EXAMPLE 2
Task: Extract all the properties for each entity from the source text.
Text: Pinkgraph is a state-of-the-art open-source package that provides a framework for building
a structured graph from any unstructured data source. Although, an entirely novel approach, it can
be seen as the next evolution of a knowledge graph. It was developed at PinkDot AI, a Delft based
AI startup.
JSON RESPONSE:
{"entities": [
  {"Pinkgraph": ["A state-of-the-art open source package that provides a framework for building a structured graph from any unstructured data source", "an entirely novel approach that can be seen as the next evolution of a knowledge graph"]},
  {"PinkDot AI": ["A Delft based AI startup"]}

REAL DATA: The following section is the real data. You should use only this real data to prepare your answer. Generate entities with properties only.
Task: Extract all the properties for each entity from the source text.
Text: {{ input_text }}
JSON response:
{"entities": [{"<ENTITY_NAME>": ["<PROPERTY_1>", "<PROPERTY_2>", "<PROPERTY_3>"]}]}
Match the properties to existing nodes only!! This is absolutely crucial!!!
Existing nodes: {{ current_nodes }}
